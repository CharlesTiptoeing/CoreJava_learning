# Traverses a string

int cp = sentence.codePointAt(i);
    if (Character.isSupplementaryCodePoint(cp)) i += 2;
    else i++;
    
## Move backforwards

i--;
    if (Character.isSurrogate(sentence.charAt(i))) i--;
    int cp = sentence.codePointAt(i);
    
### Easier way

int[] codePoints = str.codePoints().toArray();

>use **codePoints** to yield a stream of **int** values, turn the stream into array

### Turn an array of code ponits into arrays

String str = new String(codePoints, 0, codePoints.length);



1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
